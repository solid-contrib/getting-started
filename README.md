# Getting started with Solid
### Organizing, creating and building guides to the Solid Docs

Our goal:

All are welcome to participate! We invite input, feedback, questions and contributions from beginners to experienced Solid users. If you're interested in using Solid, or building Solid apps, or hosting one or more Solid servers, please join us to help introduce new members to Solid. We have adopted the Contributor Covenant, which you can read in our CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md file.
