# How-to Guides
## Task-oriented guides, focused on demonstrating specific steps, helpful while working on a project
As an example of the difference to tutorials:
- A **tutorial** might walk through **all of the steps to build an example project from scratch**, but
- a **how-to guide** might **show one thing, like, how to read from a pod**.
