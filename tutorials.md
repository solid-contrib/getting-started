# Tutorials
## Learning-oriented materials, practical, demonstrating broad topics, or a number of things combined together, useful while studying (as opposed to working on a specific project)
As an example of the difference to how-to guides:
- A **how-to guide** might show **one thing, like, how to read from a pod**, but 
- a **tutorial** might walk through **all of the steps to build an example project from scratch**
